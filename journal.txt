1 Access and Un'minimize the page code
2 Clone some <head> information, cut out unknow meta tags.
    Obs: Theres actually 12k lines of code in that simple page, impressive!
3 Gathered the font family.
4 Decided to not gather deep in the css file. (feels like cheating)
5 Came back on that decision on the likes of performance.
6 Found out some @mediakit about resposiveness, will ignore because fells too advanced for now.
7 Set navigation bar css
    Will use own names for better understanding on divs.
    Obs: After 5 hours I find myself going back and forth with divs and css, despite acheving desired results I go back for better understanding and end up breaking them.
    at moment Im between use or not use float elements or figure it out the right combination of display and position tags to achiev the 2 columns menu.
8 Used <ul> and float in menu
9 After some hours things get easier till I found the icon image sprite thing that sounds complicated, decided to use webicons instead.
